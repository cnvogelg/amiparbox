The ``parbox`` project allows to attach 8 and 32 bit microcontrollers directly
to the parallel port of a classic Amiga computer. On multiple data channels
you can transfer data from and to attached SPI and I2C devices including
Ethernet network devices, SD Cards, small displays or real time clocks.
